There are some game assets provided below, but you can create your own assets.

Requirements:
1. Use UIKit or Swift UI; no game engine or GameplayKit
2. Use swift or objective c; no third paty library
3. Object-oriented design, ideally use MVVM
4. Business logic is separated from UI code, so it is easy to switch between UIKit and Swift UI if we want to
5. The submitted solution can be compiled and run on simulator
6. Unit testing, particularly business logic is testable.
7. Please commit the solution in a git repo, then zip the repo and email it back.

Specs:
Please follow the steps below, so if you can't finish all the steps, we can still check how much you have done.
1. Create a game loop that it updates the UI at interval
2. Create a user controled spaceship, the ship moving around following user touches
3. The user spaceship fires laser at interval
4. Create enemy spaceship moving from top of screen towards the bottom
5. The enemy spaceship fires laser at interval as well
6. Removing the references of the enemy spaceships and lasers after they moving outside the screen boundary, so we don't run out of memory
7. Collision detection: if the enemy spaceship collides the user lasers, the laser will be destroyed, and spaceship loses life, eventually destroyed
8. Collision detection: if the user spaceship collides the enemy lasers, the laser will be destroyed, and spaceship loses life, eventually destroyed
9. Collision detection: if the user spaceship collides the enemy spaceship, the one has less life will be destroyed
10. The spaceship flashes when get hit
11. Update user spaceship and scores (how many enemy spaceship destroyed) on the screen
12. Feel free to add more features if you can finish all above steps
